## Elevator Pitch: 
 The short version of the idea is that this is like Tinder but for nearby restaurants. I'm going to call it Tender. Users will be able to get together, physically or not, and be able to vote on what food they want to eat that is nearby. Users will be able to blacklist certain places so that they will not appear in the possible restaurants to buy food from. Finding the correct lobby can be done via a lobby selector, which will one day be upgraded to have friends and a search function. But for now, it is meant to be a small community that needs a little help deciding where to eat.
