        <h1>Welcome to my About page for Tender!</h1>
        <p>Tender is an idea that has been tossed around on a few social media sites before. The concept itself is straightforward. Would you happen to know about Tinder? That swipe up to like, swipe down to dislike platform? This website is similar to that application but for restaurants.</p>
        <p>First, we create a lobby. That lobby will be where all your friends gather to decide where to eat out for the day. After everyone is present, simply start the round to begin voting on places to go to. There will be a variable number of rounds, depending on the restaurants in your area and your preferences.</p>
        <p>These rounds of voting will narrow down the places you can go to eat. If the final decision is one that over 50% don't like after it gets chosen, then the next closest will be chosen. That's about it! Now go ahead and have fun choosing where you are going to eat.</p>
