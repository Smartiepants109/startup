## IP
Changes each time it is started. Not doing an elastic IP. Not worth it. I'll just get the IP each time I start it and put it below this.
### CURRENTLY ONLINE -- CURRENT IP:
http://54.92.225.75/
## COMMAND TO SSH
ssh -i [key pair file] ubuntu@[ip address]


## Space for more handy info for later, lol
